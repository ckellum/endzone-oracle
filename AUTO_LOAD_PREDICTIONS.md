# Auto-Load Predictions on App Launch

## What Changed

Your app now **automatically loads your predictions** when it starts - no more manual steps!

## Before vs After

### Before (Manual Loading):
1. App opens to empty state
2. Tap Settings tab
3. Tap "Load My Predictions (15 Games)"
4. Go back to Predictions tab
5. Finally see data

### After (Automatic Loading):
1. App opens
2. Data is already loaded!
3. See all 15 predictions immediately
4. No extra steps needed!

## What Was Updated

**File Modified:**
- [NFLPredictionsApp.swift](EndZone%20Oracle/NFLPredictions/App/NFLPredictionsApp.swift)

**Change Made:**
- Added `init()` method that automatically loads your JSON file
- Loads: `enhanced_predictions_20251014_160158.json`
- Happens before the UI even appears

## How It Works

```swift
init() {
    // Auto-load predictions from bundle on app launch
    let service = PredictionService()
    service.loadPredictionsFromBundle(filename: "enhanced_predictions_20251014_160158")
    _predictionService = StateObject(wrappedValue: service)
}
```

**Sequence:**
1. App launches
2. `init()` runs immediately
3. Creates PredictionService
4. Loads your JSON from app bundle
5. UI appears with data already loaded
6. User sees predictions right away!
