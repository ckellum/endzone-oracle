# GitHub Setup Instructions for EndZone Oracle

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've already set up your local git repository:
- ✅ Git initialized with `main` branch
- ✅ Configured with your email: cjkellum@gmail.com
- ✅ Created .gitignore for Xcode projects
- ✅ Made initial commit with all your code
- ✅ 214 files committed (18,921 lines of code!)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended - 2 minutes)

**1. Create the GitHub Repository**

Go to: https://github.com/new

Fill in:
- **Repository name:** `endzone-oracle` (or `nfl-predictions-app`)
- **Description:** "EndZone Oracle - iOS app for tracking NFL game predictions with analytics and Kalshi odds integration"
- **Visibility:**
  - ✅ **Private** (recommended for now - you can make it public later)
  - Or **Public** if you want others to see your code
- **DO NOT** check:
  - ❌ "Add a README file"
  - ❌ "Add .gitignore"
  - ❌ "Choose a license"

  (We already have these locally!)

- Click **"Create repository"**

**2. Copy the Commands GitHub Shows**

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. You'll see something like:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/cjkellum/endzone-oracle.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**3. Run the Commands in Cursor**

In Cursor's terminal (or ask me to run them for you):

```bash
cd /Users/ac09540/Desktop/Sports/NFLPredictionsApp
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual values!

**4. Authenticate (First Time Only)**

When you push for the first time, GitHub will ask you to authenticate:

**Option 1: GitHub CLI (Easiest)**
- GitHub will open in your browser
- Click "Authorize"
- Done!

**Option 2: Personal Access Token**
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Give it a name: "EndZone Oracle - Cursor"
- Check scope: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
- Click "Generate token"
- Copy the token (you won't see it again!)
- Use it as your password when prompted

---

### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop (Visual - 5 minutes)

If you prefer a visual interface:

**1. Download GitHub Desktop**
- Go to: https://desktop.github.com/
- Download and install

**2. Sign In**
- Open GitHub Desktop
- Sign in with cjkellum@gmail.com

**3. Add Your Repository**
- File → Add Local Repository
- Choose: `/Users/ac09540/Desktop/Sports/NFLPredictionsApp`
- Click "Add Repository"

**4. Publish to GitHub**
- Click "Publish repository" button
- Choose name: `endzone-oracle`
- Uncheck "Keep this code private" if you want it public
- Click "Publish repository"

Done! Your code is now on GitHub.

## 🔄 Using Git in Cursor

Once your repo is on GitHub, you can use git directly in Cursor:

### Making Changes and Committing

**In Cursor:**

1. **View Changes:**
   - Open Source Control panel (Cmd + Shift + G)
   - Or click the Source Control icon in the left sidebar

2. **Stage Changes:**
   - Hover over changed files
   - Click the "+" icon to stage them
   - Or click "+" next to "Changes" to stage all

3. **Commit:**
   - Type a commit message in the text box
   - Press Cmd + Enter to commit

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Click the "..." menu in Source Control
   - Click "Push"
   - Or click the sync icon in the status bar

### Pulling Changes

If you make changes on GitHub.com or another computer:

1. In Source Control panel
2. Click "..." menu
3. Click "Pull"

### Common Git Commands in Cursor Terminal

```bash
# Check status
git status

# See what changed
git diff

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Push changes
git push

# Pull changes
git pull

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-name

# Switch branches
git checkout main

# See all branches
git branch -a
```

## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist

Once you create the GitHub repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/ac09540/Desktop/Sports/NFLPredictionsApp

# Add GitHub remote (replace with YOUR repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/cjkellum/endzone-oracle.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You'll see output like:
```
Enumerating objects: 320, done.
Counting objects: 100% (320/320), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (284/284), done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

## 🎉 Success!

Once pushed, you can:
- View your code at: `https://github.com/cjkellum/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- Clone it on other computers
- Share it with others
- Make it public for your portfolio
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Create branches for features
- Submit it as part of your App Store submission

---

## 🔒 Should You Make It Private or Public?

**Private (Recommended Initially):**
- ✅ Code is only visible to you
- ✅ Can make public later anytime
- ✅ Good while in development
- ✅ Keep App Store submission materials private

**Public:**
- ✅ Great for portfolio/resume
- ✅ Others can learn from your code
- ✅ Open source contributions welcome
- ⚠️ Anyone can see your code
- ⚠️ Don't include API keys/secrets (we already handle this with .gitignore)

**Recommendation:** Start private, make public after App Store launch.

---

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

Your `.gitignore` already protects:
- ✅ Xcode user data
- ✅ Build files
- ✅ Derived data
- ✅ User-specific settings

**Never commit:**
- ❌ API keys or secrets
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Passwords or tokens
- ❌ `.env` files with credentials

(Your Kalshi credentials are in the app only, not in source control - good!)
