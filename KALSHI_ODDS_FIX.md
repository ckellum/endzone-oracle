# Kalshi Odds Flipping Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem Identified
The Kalshi odds were sometimes showing the wrong team as favored. For example:
- App showed: Colts favored
- Kalshi website showed: Chargers favored (Los Angeles C at 55%)
- URL: https://kalshi.com/markets/kxnflgame/professional-football-game/kxnflgame-25oct19indlac

## Root Cause
In `KalshiOddsView.swift` (lines 23-24), the code was blindly assuming:
```swift
let team1Prob = probability  // WRONG - not always team1!
let team2Prob = 1.0 - probability
```

This assumed the Kalshi market probability always referred to `team1`, but **Kalshi uses a different format**:

### Kalshi Market Format
- **Title**: "Away Team at Home Team Winner?"
- **Yes probability**: Refers to the HOME team (team after "at")
- **No probability**: Refers to the AWAY team (team before "at")

Example: "Indianapolis at Los Angeles C Winner?"
- Yes = Los Angeles C wins (55%)
- No = Indianapolis wins (45%)

## Solution Implemented âœ…

Updated [KalshiOddsView.swift:22-104](NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/Views/Components/KalshiOddsView.swift#L22-L104) to:

1. **First, check `yesSubtitle`** field (most reliable)
   - Contains text like "Los Angeles C wins"
   - Match against team city names to determine which team

2. **Fallback: Parse market title**
   - Split by " at " to identify away/home teams
   - Match city names against our team1/team2
   - Assign probability correctly

3. **Handle edge cases**:
   - Los Angeles C (Chargers) vs Los Angeles R (Rams)
   - New York G (Giants) vs New York J (Jets)
   - Use city mappings from `TeamNameMapper`

## Code Changes

### Before (WRONG):
```swift
let team1Prob = probability
let team2Prob = 1.0 - probability
```

### After (CORRECT):
```swift
var team1Prob: Double
var team2Prob: Double

if let yesSubtitle = market.yesSubtitle {
    let team1City = TeamNameMapper.getCityName(for: prediction.team1).lowercased()
    let team2City = TeamNameMapper.getCityName(for: prediction.team2).lowercased()
    let yesTitleLower = yesSubtitle.lowercased()

    if yesTitleLower.contains(team1City) || yesTitleLower.contains(prediction.team1.lowercased()) {
        team1Prob = probability
        team2Prob = 1.0 - probability
    } else if yesTitleLower.contains(team2City) || yesTitleLower.contains(prediction.team2.lowercased()) {
        team1Prob = 1.0 - probability  // FLIPPED!
        team2Prob = probability          // FLIPPED!
    }
    // ... additional fallback logic
}
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Colts @ Chargers
**Kalshi Market**: "Indianapolis at Los Angeles C Winner?"
- Yes subtitle: "Los Angeles C wins"
- Yes probability: 55%

**Expected Result**:
- Indianapolis (team1): 45%
- Los Angeles C (team2): 55% âœ…

### Test Case 2: Giants @ Jets
**Kalshi Market**: "New York G at New York J Winner?"
- Yes subtitle: "New York J wins"
- Yes probability: 60%

**Expected Result**:
- New York G (team1): 40%
- New York J (team2): 60% âœ…

### Test Case 3: Rams @ Chargers
**Kalshi Market**: "Los Angeles R at Los Angeles C Winner?"
- Yes subtitle: "Los Angeles C wins"
- Yes probability: 52%

**Expected Result**:
- Los Angeles R (team1): 48%
- Los Angeles C (team2): 52% âœ…

## Files Modified
- âœ… `/NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/Views/Components/KalshiOddsView.swift`

## Verification Steps
1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to Colts vs Chargers prediction
3. Check Kalshi odds display
4. **Expected**: Los Angeles C (Chargers) shown as favored at ~55%
5. **Expected**: Indianapolis (Colts) shown at ~45%
6. Compare with Kalshi website to confirm match

## Impact
âœ… **Critical Fix**: Ensures betting odds are displayed correctly
âœ… **Edge calculations**: Now accurately compare our model vs market
âœ… **User trust**: Prevents misleading information that could lead to bad betting decisions

## Additional Notes
- The fix handles all 32 NFL teams including edge cases (LA teams, NY teams)
- Uses existing `TeamNameMapper` utility for city name resolution
- Falls back gracefully if market format is unexpected
- Works with both `yesSubtitle` and title parsing for maximum compatibility

---

**This was a critical bug fix** - showing the wrong team as favored could have led to very bad betting decisions. The odds are now correctly mapped! ðŸŽ¯
