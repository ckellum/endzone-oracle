# Updated JSON File - October 16, 2025

## Summary
The app has been updated to use the new enhanced prediction model with improved spreads and more realistic scoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. New JSON File
- **File**: `enhanced_predictions_20251016_082807.json`
- **Location**: `EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/`
- **Status**: ✅ Copied to project directory

### 2. Code Updates
- **NFLPredictionsApp.swift** (line 20): Updated to load new JSON file on app launch
- **SettingsView.swift** (line 31): Updated "Load My Predictions" button to use new file

## Model Improvements in New JSON

### Before (20251014_160158):
- Average spread: **3.0 points** (too close)
- Max spread: **10 points** (capped at 15)
- Total points range: 38-56
- Predicted ties: 2

### After (20251016_082807):
- Average spread: **6.5 points** ✅ (realistic)
- Max spread: **18 points** ✅ (no artificial cap)
- Total points range: 31-59 ✅ (wider variance)
- Predicted ties: 1

### Key Model Enhancements:
1. ✅ Removed 15-point spread cap (allows realistic blowouts)
2. ✅ Increased variance (3.5 → 5.5 in training, 2.0 → 3.5 in prediction)
3. ✅ Widened total points range (36-56 → 20-65)
4. ✅ Added home field advantage (+2.7 points)
5. ✅ Added defensive metrics (yards allowed, turnovers forced)
6. ✅ Adjusted scoring multipliers (less inflated bonuses)

## Next Steps in Xcode

### Option 1: Keep Both Files (Recommended)
The app will automatically use the new file. No Xcode changes needed.

### Option 2: Remove Old File
1. Open Xcode project
2. In Project Navigator, find `enhanced_predictions_20251014_160158.json`
3. Right-click → Delete → "Move to Trash"
4. Build and run

### Option 3: Add New File to Project (If Not Showing)
1. Open Xcode project
2. Right-click on "NFLPredictions" folder
3. Select "Add Files to 'EndZone Oracle'..."
4. Navigate to `EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/`
5. Select `enhanced_predictions_20251016_082807.json`
6. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is **unchecked** (file is already there)
7. Click "Add"
8. Build and run

## Testing
1. Build and run the app
2. App should auto-load the new predictions on launch
3. Check Settings → Current Model → Timestamp should show "20251016_082807"
4. Verify predictions show more varied spreads (up to 18 points)

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/enhanced_predictions_20251016_082807.json` (added)
- ✅ `/NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/App/NFLPredictionsApp.swift` (updated)
- ✅ `/NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (updated)

## Prediction Comparison

| Game | Old Spread | New Spread | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Steelers vs Bengals | 3 pts | 5 pts | More realistic |
| Dolphins vs Browns | 10 pts | 15 pts | Bigger blowout |
| Colts vs Chargers | 6 pts | **18 pts** | Largest spread (was capped at 15) |
| Eagles vs Vikings | 0 pts (tie) | 12 pts | No more artificial tie |

The new model creates more realistic and varied predictions based on 2025 NFL data analysis!
