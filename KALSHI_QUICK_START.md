# Kalshi Integration - Quick Start

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Configure Your API Key (2 minutes)

1. Open the app
2. Tap **Settings** (bottom right)
3. Find **Kalshi Integration** section
4. Toggle **Enable Kalshi Odds** to ON
5. Tap **API Key**
6. Paste your Kalshi API key
7. Tap **Save**

> **Don't have an API key yet?** See the full [Kalshi Integration Guide](KALSHI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for instructions on obtaining one from Kalshi.

### Step 2: View Odds (1 minute)

1. Go back to **Predictions** tab
2. Wait a few seconds for odds to load
3. Pull down to refresh if needed

### Step 3: Understand What You're Seeing

Each game card now shows:

```
ðŸ“Š Kalshi Market          65%
Will the Chiefs win against the Raiders?

ðŸŸ¢ Value Bet: 10.0%
```

**What this means:**
- The Kalshi prediction market gives the Chiefs a 65% chance to win
- Your model predicts a higher probability
- There's a 10% "edge" (potential value bet)

## Color Guide

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green (Value Bet)**: Your model is more bullish than the market (5%+ difference)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange (Close Match)**: Your prediction closely matches the market
- ðŸ”´ **Red (Market Favors)**: The market is more bullish than your model

## Testing the Integration

### Quick Test Checklist

âœ… Enable Kalshi odds in Settings  
âœ… Save your API key  
âœ… Return to Predictions tab  
âœ… See "Kalshi Market" section on game cards  
âœ… Pull to refresh to update odds  
âœ… Tap a game card to see full market details  

### Expected Behavior

**When Working Correctly:**
- Kalshi odds appear within 3-5 seconds
- Each game shows market probability
- Edge indicators display (green/orange/red)
- Pull-to-refresh updates odds

**Potential Issues:**
- "No Kalshi markets available" - Normal for some games
- Loading takes >10 seconds - Check internet connection
- Error message - Verify API key is correct

## API Endpoints Reference

The app queries these Kalshi API endpoints:

```
Base URL: https://trading-api.kalshi.com

GET /trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=NFL&limit=200
GET /trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=FOOTBALL&limit=200
GET /trade-api/v2/markets?series_ticker=NFLGAME&limit=200
```

The app tries multiple series tickers to find NFL markets, as Kalshi's naming convention may vary.

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Problem: No odds showing

**Fix 1:** Check Settings
- Go to Settings â†’ Kalshi Integration
- Ensure toggle is ON and API key is saved

**Fix 2:** Refresh
- Pull down on Predictions list
- Tap Settings then back to Predictions

**Fix 3:** Restart app
- Close and reopen the app

### Problem: "Invalid API key" error

**Fix:** Update API key
1. Go to Kalshi website
2. Generate new API key
3. Settings â†’ Kalshi Integration â†’ API Key
4. Paste new key and save

### Problem: Only some games have odds

**This is normal!** Kalshi may not have markets for all games. Markets are created based on demand and timing.

## Understanding the Data

### Market Probability
The percentage shown is derived from Kalshi's contract price:
- 60% = Contract trading at Â¢60 (out of Â¢100)
- Higher % = Market thinks team is more likely to win

### Your Model's Probability
Calculated from predicted scores:
```
Team Win % = Team Points / Total Points
Example: 26 points out of 46 total = 56.5%
```

### The Edge
```
Edge = Your Probability - Market Probability
Example: 56.5% - 60% = -3.5% (Market Favors)
Example: 65% - 55% = +10% (Value Bet)
```

## Next Steps

Once you've confirmed the integration works:

1. **Explore Markets**: Tap game cards to see detailed market information
2. **Track Performance**: Note which "value bets" actually win
3. **Adjust Threshold**: The 5% edge threshold is configurable in future versions
4. **Compare Results**: See how your predictions stack up against the market

## Privacy Note

Your Kalshi API key is:
- âœ… Stored only on your device
- âœ… Sent only to Kalshi's official API
- âœ… Never transmitted to third parties
- âœ… Can be removed anytime in Settings
