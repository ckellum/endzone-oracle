# ✅ Your JSON File is Now in the App!

## What Was Done

### 1. Added JSON to Project Bundle
Your `enhanced_predictions_20251014_160158.json` file has been:
- ✅ Copied to the project folder
- ✅ Added to Xcode project references
- ✅ Configured as a bundle resource
- ✅ Will be included in the app when you build

### 2. Created Bundle Loading Method
Added new method to `PredictionService.swift`:
```swift
func loadPredictionsFromBundle(filename: String)
```
testingo for git

This loads JSON files directly from the app bundle (no file picker needed!)

### 3. Updated Settings View
Added a new button in Settings → Data Management:
- **"Load My Predictions (15 Games)"** ⭐ (Green star icon)
  - Loads your actual JSON file from the bundle
  - Shows all 15 games immediately
  - No file picker needed!

- **"Import Other JSON File"** (Blue download icon)
  - Opens file picker
  - For loading other JSON files

## How to Use

### Option 1: In the App (Recommended)
1. Build and run the app (Cmd+R)
2. Go to **Settings** tab (gear icon)
3. Tap **"Load My Predictions (15 Games)"** ⭐
4. Your 15 predictions will load instantly!
5. Go to **Predictions** tab to see them

### Option 2: Sample Data Button
The "Load Sample Data" button in the Predictions tab also works for testing.

## Your Predictions Will Show

Once loaded, you'll see all 15 games:
1. Pittsburgh Steelers vs Cincinnati Bengals (21-18)
2. Los Angeles Rams vs Jacksonville Jaguars (25-26)
3. New Orleans Saints vs Chicago Bears (20-18)
