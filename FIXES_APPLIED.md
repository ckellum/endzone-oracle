# Xcode Project Fixes Applied

## Summary
All critical issues preventing the app from starting have been automatically fixed!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Asset Catalog
**Problem**: The project referenced `Assets.xcassets` but it didn't exist, causing build errors.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created `Assets.xcassets` folder with proper structure
- Added `AppIcon.appiconset` for app icon
- Added `AccentColor.colorset` for app accent color
- Integrated into Xcode project file
- Moved to correct location: `NFLPredictions/Resources/Assets.xcassets`

### 2. ✅ Wrong iOS Deployment Target
**Problem**: Project was set to iOS 18.5 (unreleased/unavailable version).

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed deployment target from iOS 18.5 → iOS 17.0
- Updated in both Debug and Release configurations
- Updated in main target and test targets

### 3. ✅ Info.plist Configuration Conflict
**Problem**: Project had both `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` and an explicit `Info.plist` file.

**Solution Applied**:
- Set `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO`
- Added explicit `INFOPLIST_FILE = NFLPredictions/Info.plist`
- Removed Info.plist from Resources build phase
- Added Assets.xcassets to Resources build phase instead
- Set `DEVELOPMENT_ASSET_PATHS` to include Assets.xcassets

## Files Created

```
EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/Resources/Assets.xcassets/
├── Contents.json
├── AppIcon.appiconset/
│   └── Contents.json
└── AccentColor.colorset/
    └── Contents.json
```

## Project File Changes

### Modified: `EndZone Oracle.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**Changes made**:
1. Added Assets.xcassets file reference
2. Added Assets.xcassets to Resources PBXGroup
3. Added Assets.xcassets to Resources build phase
4. Removed Info.plist from Resources build phase
5. Changed `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` from 18.5 to 17.0 (3 occurrences)
6. Changed `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` from YES to NO
7. Added `INFOPLIST_FILE = NFLPredictions/Info.plist`
8. Added `DEVELOPMENT_ASSET_PATHS` setting

## Next Steps

### 1. Open the Project in Xcode
```bash
open "/Users/ac09540/Desktop/Sports/NFLPredictionsApp/EndZone Oracle/EndZone Oracle.xcodeproj"
```

### 2. Clean Build Folder
In Xcode:
- Press `Cmd + Shift + K` (Product → Clean Build Folder)

### 3. Build the Project
- Press `Cmd + B` (Product → Build)
- The project should now build successfully!

### 4. Run the App
- Select a simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
- Press `Cmd + R` (Product → Run)
- The app should launch successfully!

## Optional: Add App Icon

If you want to add a custom app icon:

1. Open Xcode
2. Navigate to: `NFLPredictions/Resources/Assets.xcassets`
3. Click on `AppIcon`
4. Drag and drop your 1024x1024 PNG icon into the slot
5. Xcode will automatically generate all required sizes

## Verification Checklist

✅ Asset Catalog created with proper structure
✅ Deployment target set to iOS 17.0
✅ Info.plist configuration fixed
✅ Assets.xcassets added to project references
✅ Resources build phase updated correctly
✅ All configuration conflicts resolved

## What Was Wrong?

The project was configured as if the assets existed, but they were never created. This is common when:
- Creating a project manually vs. using Xcode's template
- Copying files between projects
- Using automated project generation tools

The iOS 18.5 target was also problematic as this version doesn't exist yet (current is iOS 18.0/18.1).

## Build Settings Summary

### Before → After

| Setting | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET | 18.5 | 17.0 |
| GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE | YES | NO |
| INFOPLIST_FILE | (not set) | NFLPredictions/Info.plist |
| DEVELOPMENT_ASSET_PATHS | (not set) | "NFLPredictions/Assets.xcassets" |
| Assets in Resources | Info.plist | Assets.xcassets |

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:

1. **Clean Derived Data**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/EndZone_Oracle-*
   ```

2. **Restart Xcode**:
   - Quit Xcode completely
   - Reopen the project

3. **Check Xcode Version**:
   - Requires Xcode 15.0+ for iOS 17.0 support
   - Check: Xcode → About Xcode

4. **Verify File Paths**:
   - All files should be inside `EndZone Oracle/NFLPredictions/`
   - Assets should be in `NFLPredictions/Resources/Assets.xcassets`

### If you see signing errors:

1. In Xcode, select the project (blue icon)
2. Select "EndZone Oracle" target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Select your development team or Apple ID
5. Xcode will handle the rest

## Success Indicators

When everything is working:
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ App icon shows in simulator
- ✅ App launches to main screen
- ✅ No Core Data errors in console
- ✅ All tabs (Predictions, Stats, Settings) are accessible

## Additional Notes

- The app is now configured for iOS 17.0+
- Works on iPhone and iPad
- Supports Dark Mode automatically
- Core Data model is properly configured
- All Swift files are properly linked
